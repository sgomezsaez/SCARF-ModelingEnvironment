/**
 * This package contains the REST resources
 * 
 * Mostly, they produces Viewables, where a JSP and the current resource is
 * passed As the JSP itself handles plain Java objects and not Responses, the
 * resources have also methods returning POJOs. This might be ugly design, but
 * was quick to implement.
 * 
 * The package structure is mirrored in src/main/webapp/jsp to ease finding the
 * JSPs belonging to a resource.
 * 
 * The resources are <em>not</em> in line with the resource model of the TOSCA
 * container. Especially, we do not employ HATEOAS here.
